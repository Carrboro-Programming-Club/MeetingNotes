# November 1st -- second meeting

## What we've covered so far...

* importance of using git for software version management (svm)  
* general desire of the group to cover technologies that are ubiquitous in the industry
* interest in front-end technologies



## problems with choosing a 'newer technology' 

* Might not have staying power in an extremely fast-moving industry
* high competition from 'inner circle' devs AND fewer companies hiring
* being scoffed at by veterans of the industry
  * in their 'youth', they most likely failed to implement new processes and technologies
  * there are reasons for the existing processes
  * these 'veteran' workers have seen **many** new crazes come and go
  * there are companies out there using programming languages from the 70's (aka cobol)



## Why we are going to start with 'the basics' aka HTML

* It will *never* go away. (Much to the chagrin of people who fumble with css)
* Immediate results (example)
  * make changes in a .html file, open it in a browser and see changes
* Designing most user interfaces will follow a similar 'declarative pattern' in ANY language. The 'design' language is almost entirely transferable to new environments
* The html standard has evolved over time to have MANY complex features
